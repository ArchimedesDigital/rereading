Brainstorm Analysis | Parul and Montse
# select responses with negative connotations (sad, miscarriage) when the context
# was "This is an ad." and find the difference between avg view times of these
# students' with those of neutral connotations (confused, sale). Our 'hypothesis' is that there
# might be a statistically significant difference showing students with responses of negative
# connotations (i.e. got the deeper meaning of text w/o clue from context) had a correlation
# with spending more time with the text


# select students with responses with neutral connotations (confused, sale) when the context was
# "This is an ad." but had responses with negative connotations when the context was
# "This is a short story." Subtract the former from latter and take the average. This will tell us
# about how much time it takes for students to make the deeper connection.
